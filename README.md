# NeoCord - Bundle

# What is "NeoCord"? (Reffered as `NC` in code)

NeoCord, is another client modification for Discord, it is centerred mostly around developers & somewhat security¹, such features are `Loaders` and `Permissions`²

# Documentation, and Installation

All documentation & installtion steps are [here](docs/)

# FAQs
## What are "Loaders"?

Loaders are the ones who load your Plugins, Themes, and Fonts. Moving to such things is a great choice, because you can focus on making one thing, without breaking anything else, or change plugin loading, without switching clients. There will be 4 official Loaders:
* NC:VDLoader (for VD plugins)²
* NC:PluginLoader (for NC plugins)²
* NC:ThemeLoader (for themes)²
* NC:FontLoader (for fonts)²

Any other info is unavalilable as of right now, because the project is still under phase of construction.

Other things NC will support:
* NC:PluginBrowser - Browse plugins with repo system²
* NC:Cloud - Store your Settings, All plugins on specialized cloud²³

Information will change as fast as itll form, so check back later! We will also have documentation (VD's plugins docs wont be made, sorry! ||(atleast, at current situation)||)

# Notes

* 1 - doesnt mean that people which are not interested, do not, or cant code mustnt or cant use NC. NC is made for everyone, from people to people
* 2 - name(s) may or may not change later
* 3 - It will only store links to them, CloudSync probably wont work for NC, because it probably wont pick up the NC.VDLoader plugin loader
